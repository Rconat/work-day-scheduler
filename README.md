# work-day-scheduler

## Description 

The purpose of this program is to create a scheduler that anyone can use to plan out their work day.

This can be used to provide a planner with the hours between 9:00AM and 9:00PM in which a user and input events. Upon clicking the save button, the website will save that data locally to the users device so that next time the page is opened, the events will all remain in their appropriate time slots. Using colors the webpage will also denoted which event block is currently happening(red) as well as which blocks have passed (light-grey) and which have not yet passed (green).

The webpage is hosted on [GitHub](https://rconat.github.io/work-day-scheduler/).

You can find the repo on [GitHub](https://github.com/Rconat/work-day-scheduler).

## Usage 

This application provides an easy way to track things you need to do for a single day. It will provide a quick reference for anyone using the website and since the events are stored locally, it will be unique for each user.

## Credits

For this assignment I found a really nice bit of code for adding the ordinal suffixes for numbers. I used this code to add the ordinal suffix to the day of the month (i.e. December 10 would now read December 10th). The code can be found on [w3resource.com](https://www.w3resource.com/javascript-exercises/fundamental/javascript-fundamental-exercise-122.php). The source is also notated in the script comments.
